            <h1>Travelling</h1>
          <p>The thing I enjoy the most in life is travelling around the world and enjoying other cultures. In general i'm not the most sociable person but when I'm travelling I come out of my shell and I feel genuinely happy. Beside that there is so many things to enjoy while travelling, think about all the different kinds of food and meeting people from other cultures. I also very much enjoy searching for less touristic places that have a more authentic feeling to it what makes everything feel even better.</p>
          <p>Going around the world and visiting different places has always been a constant thing for me, that's also why it is important to me. Unfortunately during the pandemic I had a travel drought of 2 years, but I decided to get back into it this year because I missed it too much. This is also a reason why I took a 1 year break from school so I could enjoy the time off from all the chaos that was going on in the world.</p>
          <p>This last year I have travelled to a couple of different places, these u can find in the other page called "LastSummer" here I talk about my experiences in 2022.</p>

            <h1>Gaming</h1>
          <p>Beside travelling gaming is a big part of my life too. I have been doing it for as long as I have a conscience and I very much enjoy doing it. For me and probably for many other people, it's a way to relieve stress and to stop worrying about things that are going on in real life. Obviously aside of that it's also an excellent source of entertainment which you can enjoy with your friends.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned it is a way to enjoy your time with friends, this is certainly the case for me. I have gotten to know some of my best friends through gaming and I am very happy I got to know them.</p>
          <p>In the picture you can see the game RocketLeague, this is a highly competitive game which I have spent lots of time on in the last years, this because I like the competitive side of it. I can personally say I have gotten pretty good at the game since I am currently places right under professional level in the game which is pretty good considering only 1.2% of players have achieved this ranking.</p>

            <h1>Work</h1>
          <p>Lastly but not least important, I also have a student job. Currently I am working for the company called Unikoo, here I work as web/app developer as a jobstudent. Obviously I am not yet knowledgable in everything but I get plenty of help from the other developers. I helped them make their website and also made one of their apps they made for their client supportable in multiple languages.</p>
          <p>During my time here I have worked with new libraries that I haven't seen in school yet, such as react.js , next.js and vue.js I have learned a lot during my time there and I hope to keep being able to do my work there in the future and maybe after I graduate.</p>
