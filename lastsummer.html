            <h1>Morocco</h1>
          <p>First I went to Morocco this was around June/July, we have a house there and I went there with my family. It wasn't amazing since I got covid nearing the end of the trip so that was not so amazing</p>
          <p>however the food and culture there is always good and that I certainly enjoyed.</p>

            <h1>Seoul - South Korea</h1>
          <p>My second trip was to South Korea, more specifically Seoul. I went here with my girlfriend, and it was just amazing. The food was super good, the people were super nice and just the culture is amazing. I really recommend going there if you can, and I will certainly go back again.</p>

            <h1>Paris</h1>
          <p>At the beginning of October I went to Paris with my girlfriend since she will study here from Januari, so we went to checkout some places. I personally am not a huge fan of Paris but it's a nice city nonetheless.</p>

            <h1>Germany</h1>
          <p>Also to Germany I went with my girlfriend, but this time more to visit her since she was visiting family there and doing paperwork. I quite liked it but in my opinion it's pretty similar to Belgium so it wasn't that amazing in my opinion.</p>
